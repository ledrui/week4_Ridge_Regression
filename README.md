# week4_Ridge_Regression

Ridge regression aims to avoid overfitting by adding a cost to the RSS term of standard least squares that depends on the 2-norm of the coefficients ∥w∥∥w∥. The result is penalizing fits with large coefficients. The strength of this penalty, and thus the fit vs. model complexity balance, is controled by a parameter lambda (here called "L2_penalty").
